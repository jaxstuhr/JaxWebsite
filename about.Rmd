__Research__

After graduating from UC Berkeley with a degree in Physics in Spring of 2020, I went on to work in the Energy Systems Divsion at Argonne National Lab. My research focused on projecting the potential for a variety of novel biofuel pathways to help decarbonize the marine shipping center. 

Here at UC Santa Barbara I've joined Eric Masanet's Lab where my work focuses on guiding decarbonization pathways for the industrial sector. Currently I am focused on forecasting the energy savings potential associated with implementing the best available technologies throughout industry in the US. Moving forward I aim to focus on detailed decarbonization plans that are optimized with respect to environmental, social, and economic impacts.


__Hobbies__

Outside of academics, I love to spend time outdoors, primarily rock climbing all over California. I've spent extensive time climbing in Tahoe, Yosemite, and the Eastern Sierra, and I look forward to spending the next 5 years exploring the *fantastic* sandstone here in the Santa Barbara mountains.
